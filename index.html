    <h1>StudyFlash — Privacy & App Policy</h1>
    <p><small>App: <strong>StudyFlash</strong> — Owner: <strong>Florescu Eduard</strong></small></p>
    <p><small>Last updated: December 9, 2025</small></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This policy explains how the StudyFlash mobile application handles information. StudyFlash is a simple study/flashcard app created and owned by Florescu Eduard.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Data collection</h2>
    <p><strong>No personal data collected or stored:</strong> StudyFlash does not collect, transmit, or store personal information (such as name, email, phone number) on a remote server. The app does not use any external database.</p>
    <p><strong>Local data:</strong> Any content you create inside the app (flashcards, local settings, progress) is stored only on your device. It is not uploaded or shared unless you explicitly export it using features built into your device (if available).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>StudyFlash does not request unnecessary permissions. The app only requests permissions required for features you opt to use (for example, if an export feature uses local file access). If no such features are present, the app requests no special permissions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Analytics, Advertising & Third-party services</h2>
    <p>This version of StudyFlash does not include analytics, advertising SDKs, or third-party tracking services. If third-party services are added in a future update (for analytics, crash reporting, or ads), this policy will be updated and you will be informed of what is collected and why.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>StudyFlash is not designed specifically for children under 13. Because the app does not collect personal information, parental consent features are not required. If any data-collection features are added later that could affect children, this policy will be revised to comply with applicable law (for example, COPPA in the U.S.).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Because StudyFlash does not transmit or store personal data on servers, the risk of remote data exposure is minimal. Local data is stored by the operating system; users are responsible for device-level security (lock screen, backups). If synchronization or cloud backup is added later, encryption and secure transmission will be used and documented here.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Data retention & export</h2>
    <p>Your local data remains on your device until you delete the app or the data yourself. If the app offers an export feature, exported files are handled by your device and any chosen destination (email, cloud storage) and are outside the control of StudyFlash once exported.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. When material changes occur (for example, adding analytics, a remote database, or ads) the policy will be revised and the "Last updated" date above will be changed accordingly.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>Owner: <strong>Florescu Eduard</strong></p>
    <p>Contact email: <em>eduard.florescu.edw@gmail.com</em></p>
    <p>Please replace the email above with a real contact address before publishing. If you prefer, you can include a website or other contact method here instead.</p>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <p><small>Note: This is a basic policy template intended to match the app description: "no DB, local-only data". If you later add analytics, ads, remote sync, or any data export that transmits personal information, you must update this policy and inform users as required by Google Play / local law.</small></p>
